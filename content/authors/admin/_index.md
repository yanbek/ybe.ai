I am a Ph.D. Candidate of artificial intelligence at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). My research interests include Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Bayesian inference.

I am currently finishing my Master's thesis on XAI while starting on a Ph.D. My Ph.D. is about developing new methods for XAI using a probabilistic approach. The algorithms aim to make Deep Learning methods more interpretable. In conclusion, my goal is to build machine learning models that have high performance while retaining transparency.
