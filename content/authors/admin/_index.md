Yanzhe Bekkemoen is a Ph.D. Candidate of artificial intelligence at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). His research interests include Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Bayesian approaches.

He is currently finishing his Master's thesis on XAI while starting on his Ph.D. His Ph.D. is about developing new methods for XAI using a probabilistic approach. The algorithms aim to make Deep Learning methods more interpretable. In conclusion, the goal is to achieve machine learning models that have high performance while retaining transparency.
